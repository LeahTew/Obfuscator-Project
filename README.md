# Obfuscator-Project
GDPR Obfuscator Project for Launchpad

A general-purpose tool that can be integrated as a library module into a Python codebase.

The tool will be deployed within the AWS account, supplied with the S3 location of a file containing sensitive information, and the names of the affected fields. It will create a new file containing an exact copy of the input file but with the sensitive data replaced with obfuscated strings. 

The calling procedure will handle saving the output to its destination.
